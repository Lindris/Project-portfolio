# Project-portfolio images and project summaries:
This repository contains two files with images depicting my two major projects completed on School of Code Bootcamp. 

View the project overviews by opening the files for Co:llab and Untied. Each image montage illustrates and provides a summary description of the project journey from ideation to delivery, represented by three stages: the beginning, the design stage and the delivery stage. 

To view the deployed web applications at completion of each project, visit my Profile Page and follow the project links. 

1. A four week final project, undertaken in a group of five, none of whom had ever worked together before. {Co:llab} an event planning app enables Bootcamp graduates and others learning to code to join and create events to meet and code together collaboratively and learn from industry experts. The MVP was reached and reiterated several times with additional features added. If more time had been available the features would have been developed further. 

2. A one week project completed half way through Bootcamp in a group of three who had not worked together as a team before. Untied is a resources app that is designed to enable Bootcampers to easily access learning material to consolidate Bootcamp topics to help keep up with the intensive learning pace. Within the short project period, the MVP was reached, and the app would have had additional content and features if more time was available.
